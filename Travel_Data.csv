1,"Luksentyre, Outer Hebrides, Scotland",Beach,"At the end of a winding road on the wind-battered west coast of the Isle of Harris, you�ll find something to make your eyes pop. Luskentyre Beach is a paint splash of brilliant white, surrounded by almost impossibly azure water. On a sunny day, it�s so unerringly blue you may find it hard to believe you are at a beach in Scotland at all. But regardless of its paradoxically tropical feel, it�s at its most beautiful when eel-coloured storm clouds roll in and seas turn flinty, turning this dramatic landscape an eerie monochrome."
2,"Dune Du Pilat, France",Beach,"In the warmer months, Europe�s tallest sand dune, just an hour�s drive from Bordeaux, is cloaked in a constant, shimmering heat haze, giving the illusion that this sprawling French beach is scattered with gleaming treasure. The sand here, which forms peaks as high as 300 feet, is as finely milled as fresh flour, perfect for sausage-rolling your way down to the tussocky Atlantic shoreline and standing to gaze back at the pine forests behind the beach. The surrounding Arcachon Bay holds miles of beaches ripe for exploring, and you�ll find a jumble of huts nearby where fishermen set up tables to sell oysters, p�t� and prawns."
3,Ora Beach Indonesia,Beach,"With a higgledy-piggledy 37,000-mile coastline (the world�s second longest), Indonesia has a glut of beautiful beaches. One of its finest is Ora, snuggled away on the north coast of sparsely populated Seram island. The area is known as Indonesia�s Little Maldives due to its agate seas and white-sugar beaches, but the island still retains something of a wild feel. Seram sits amid several tectonic plates, meaning that the surrounding landscape varies cinematically, from lush, bird-speckled tropical rainforest to ogre-like mountains."
4,Awaroa South Island New Zealand,Beach,"Set deep in the heart of New Zealand�s glorious Abel Tasman National Park, Awaroa is hemmed in by clover-green native bush and seas that sparkle like freshly blown glass. Most visitors come here either by water � swooshing in on kayaks or small boats � or on foot, to ramble around the park�s lush forests. It has an important place in the hearts of the locals, who banded together to crowdfund the purchase of the privately held beachfront when it came up for sale in 2016, thus giving this pretty part of the planet the nickname the �People�s Beach�."
5,Die Plast Walker Bay Nature Reserve South Africa,Beach,"Don�t be surprised to spot the occasional southern right whale wallowing offshore at Die Plaat, a ruggedly beautiful swath of sand fringed by rocky limestone outcrops near Hermanus, South Africa�s whale capital. Chubby seals slouch on the rocky shoreline here, and you�ll find the ground littered with huge, pearlescent abalone shells. There�s history to be courted in these wind-whipped sands as well; the beach is home to Klipgat Cave, a bat-filled cavern where late Middle Stone Age people lived up to 85,000 years ago (keep your eyes peeled � you may even spot ancient tools on the ground)."
6,"Grand Anse, Grenada",Beach,"You�ll find no shortage of beautiful beaches in Grenada, but tranquil, sheltered Grand Anse is one of the best. Two miles of milky-white sand on the western, leeward side of the island, it�s a short water-taxi ride from the capital of St George�s, and is overlooked by some of Grenada�s finest hotels. You won�t want for anything here, whether it�s goblet-sized G&Ts, market stalls or seahorses that swoosh around snorkellers."
7,"Honopu Beach, Kauai, Hawaii",Beach,"The only (legal) way to reach remote Honopu is by water, meaning you have to swim from an offshore boat, or from neighboring Kalalau Beach, a quarter of a mile away (fins are a must). But given that the cayenne-coloured cliffs and smooth sands of this isolated spot provided the backdrop for Raiders of the Lost Ark and King Kong, the schlep is cinematically worth it. Since the valley is so isolated, it is also believed to be spiritual, and served as an ancient burial ground for local chiefs."
8,"Keem Bay, Achill Island, Ireland",Beach,"It�s a windy road to Keem Bay, but the staggering cliff-top views are worth it. This sheltered inlet, on Achill Island in County Mayo, is almost unknown to visitors, but its clear malachite waters and soft biscuit sand make it a family-friendly spot � that�s also wonderfully crowd-free. Bring binoculars for spotting basking sharks; in warmer months you�ll find herds of ice-cream vans in the car park."
9,"Fakarava, French Polynesia",Beach,"With its collection of easily accessible white and pink sand beaches, Fakarava � one of the largest atolls in French Polynesia � is one of the best snorkelling locations in the world, with consistently warm waters. While the sea is a safe haven for rare fish, fluorescent corals and �walls� of sharks that pass close by the shore, the unblemished beaches have a claim to fame as the inspiration for Matisse�s bleu period. The artist spent three months in nearby Tahiti in 1930, and was enthralled by the lagoons� infinite blues."
10,"Marathonisi, Zakynthos, Greece",Beach,"Better known as Turtle Island, the spotless white-sand islet of Marathonisi is a vital nesting spot for endangered loggerhead sea turtles, meaning visitors must stay within five metres of the water to avoid disturbing them. Fill your lungs with the pine-scented air before exploring the surrounding sea caves by snorkel or boat but be sure to bring supplies: you�ll find nothing on this Greek Island beach but seals, turtles and forests."
11,"Praia Do Sancho, Brazil",Beach,"Found on Fernando de Noronha,an archipelago of volcanic islands between Brazil and Africa, Praia do Sancho is consistently voted one of the world�s best beaches. It�s also one of the hardest to access. Flights from mainland Brazil take about an hour, then you must hike, scooch down narrow rock tunnels and descend steep ladder steps to reach the golden palm-fringed sands. You have to pay an environment tax to get in, as the area is a National Park (head to the park�s offices, a 15-minute drive away), but once you�re there, its deserted shoreline, giant lumbering iguanas and fish-flecked shallows are worth the sweat."
12,"Chesterman Beach, Vancouver Island, Canada",Beach,"Another wild beauty, Chesterman�s wide beach of smooth sand � dotted with huge driftwood logs and fringed by wolf-filled forest � is popular with die-hard surfers and windswept strollers when the tide recedes. It�s overlooked by the fantastic Wickaninnish Inn, an atmospheric place to shelter and keep an eye out for passing sea otters when bloated storm clouds roll in."
13,"Anse Source D'argent, Seychelles",Beach,"One of the must visit beach in the world! Possibly one of the most photogenic places in the world, Anse Source d�Argent on La Digue is the original Bounty advert beach, cloaked in pure white sand and strewn with hefty granite boulders. It is not, by any stretch, deserted, but visit in the early morning] and you�ll get there before the daytrippers from Mah� and Praslin. For your own pocket of paradise, walk southwards through the shallows past the first set of boulders. The bay opens up for added breathing space."
14,"Seagrass Bay, Laucala Island, Fiji",Beach,"Covered in sultry tropical jungle and accessible only via guided walking tours or horseback safaris, the private-island and beach hideaway of Laucala is an unfathomably beautiful spot, home to some of Fiji�s rarest birds, hordes of marine life and spellbinding beaches. Seagrass Bay is the quietest and prettiest, but if its real adventure you�re after, head slightly further off-shore to get up close to the magnificent sea-life in a submersible."
15,"Hidden Beach, Palawan Philippines",Beach,"It�s not quite so hidden any more, but this beach still makes its mark as one of the world�s best. Palawan is filled with pristinely beautiful spots but Hidden Beach � surrounded by imposing limestone cliffs and with startlingly bone-white sand � is separated from the turquoise ocean by a small keyhole-like opening, through which visitors must climb in order to access the lagoon."
16,"Ile Aux Cerfs, Mauritius",Beach,"Named for the cerfs, the stags imported from Java for hunting, Ile aux Cerfs has become something of a victim of its own famous beauty, much of it overrun with obtrusive crowds and pesky beach touts. But you need only hike half a mile down the beach and you�ll be rewarded with some incredible island sands that you can keep all to yourself. This place is popular for a reason."
17,"Tortuga Bay, Santa Cruz Island, Gal�pagos",Beach,"With ghost-white sand, black lava rock and gaggles of marine iguanas, Tortuga Bay or Beach is an almost surreal place. It�s two miles out of the main town of Puerto Ayora, and the hike can be hot and sticky, but once there allow yourself to be distracted by sharks patrolling the shallows, apple-red crabs scuttling across the sands and the swoop of blue-footed boobies coming into land, then cool off with a spot of breaststroke among the mangroves."
18,"Turquoise Bay, Exmouth, Western Australia",Beach,"This beach one is world heritage listed site. Launch yourself into the crystalline waters of Turquoise Bay and you�ll be swimming within a few feet of the pristine Ningaloo Reef, a World Heritage-listed site that�s home to the largest congregation of whale sharks on the planet. A 40-mile drive from Exmouth on Australia�s Western coast, it�s a beach of blindingly white sands and impeccable snorkelling � you�ll descend to see rainbow corals, peaceful turtles and more than 500 fish species."
19,"Pink Sand Beach, Barbuda",Beach,"This endlessly photogenic, often empty beach is made from crushed corals that have been ground into fine silk-like sand. Barbuda, Antigua�s sister island, is less crowded than most of the Caribbean, meaning you may find you have this eight-mile swathe of sand � which glows candy-floss-pink in the sun � entirely to yourself. There are no public facilities per se, but you�ll find a few beachy cafes scattered alongside the surf for a cooling cocktail."
20,"Playa Manuel, Antonio, Costa Rica",Beach,"This popular family beach borders the wildlife-filled Manuel Antonio National Park, where three-toed sloths and white-faced capuchin monkeys emerge from the coastal rainforest to the delight of tiny beachgoers. It�s a 30-minute hike from the entrance to the park (keep your eyes peeled for howler monkeys crashing through the canopy), but once there you�ll find soft sands, excellent swimming and honey-hued sunsets."
21,"Gantheaume Point, Broome, Western Australia",Beach,"With a backdrop of saffron-coloured cliffs and lapped by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, this rugged beach is one of the southern hemisphere�s most photogenic. Cast your eye across the robin-egg-blue waters and you might spot the snouts of rare snubfin dolphins breaking the surface, then turn back to the old lighthouse tower to see ospreys nesting in the framework. When the tide is at its lowest, a smattering of 125-million-year-old dinosaur footprints are unveiled, preserved impeccably in the amber-coloured reef rock."
22,"Dolfynstrand, Namibia",Beach,"Set on the edge of the Namib-Naukluft National Park � the oldest desert on the planet � and a 15-minute drive from seaside hub Walvis Bay. The primeval Dolfynstrand beach is not a soft-waves-and-sand-between-your-toes sort of place � instead there are eerie shipwrecks strewn on the sand and a stinking, snoozing seal colony up the coast. But given its remote location in one of the world�s most sparsely populated countries, any beachcombers are unlikely to have to jostle for space."
23,"Ocracoke Lifeguarded Beach, North Carolina",Beach,"More of an unpolished gem than a screensaver beach, the wind-pummelled Ocracoke on the Outer Banks of North Carolina has been described as one of the USA�s wildest. Once the temporary home of Blackbeard the pirate and his fellow buccaneers, it rocks some seriously big surfing waves in the late summer, while more tranquil waters earlier in the year (plus changing facilities and ample parking) are ideal for salt-water-seeking families."
24,"Rau�asandur Beach, Iceland",Beach,"Glowering below the rocks of Iceland�s western fjords is the moody Rau�asandur Beach, distinguished by its copper-red sands, a result of billions of pulverised scallop shells. Reached by winding gravel road, this is edged by formidable mountains and dramatic cliffs. But you�re unlikely to see another human here � only a tenth of Iceland�s visitors ever make it as far as the Westfjords."
25,"Jibei Island Beach, Taiwan",Beach,"Found in Penghu County, among the remote western islands of Taiwan, Jibei beach is an almost untouched spot, out of reach of most city-going travellers. Getting here involves taking a boat from the North Sea Tourist Centre to the main part of the island, where there are plenty of watersports, sun umbrellas and wooden cabins for an overnight stay. But it�s the secluded, often deserted sandspit, a 15-minute walk away, that�s truly special. There are no man-made intrustions here � just the murmur of the ocean and a mile of untrodden sand."
26,"Wonderland Trail Mount Rainier National Park, Washington",Hiking/Mountain,"Just because this trail circumnavigates, rather than summits, 14,411-foot Mount Rainier, don�t assume it�s an easy walk in Mount Rainier National Park. Think of it this way: with a total elevation gain of 22,000 feet, it�s sort of like summitting the active volcano twice, minus the scary crevasses. Spread the hike over 10 to 14 days to fully appreciate this epic meander through the most beautiful terrain in the Pacific Northwest, from lowland forests and subalpine meadows to wide-open valleys with views of Rainier�s icy glaciers. With 18 designated wilderness camps and four resupply mailboxes, the trail is well maintained and designed with thru-hikers in mind. Apply for a permit well before the April 1 deadline to get a coveted July-to-September slot and avoid the snow that lingers in the higher elevations into June."
27,"Kalalau Trail Kauai, Hawaii",Hiking/Mountain,"Patience is a virtue when planning to hike this lush, steep trail along Kauai�s famously fluted Na Pali Coast. With its 300-foot-high waterfalls, views to the crashing Pacific, and access to two stunning sand beaches, Hanakapiai and the completely isolated Kalalau, this out-and-back trek is worth every rigorous step. But because of heavy flooding in 2018, it will be closed until at least mid-2019. Even when the trail is open, access can be hard to come by. Hiking farther than two miles requires a permit, and to mitigate growing congestion and overtourism on Kauai�s north shore, the state is also building a new parking area near the trailhead that will limit daily visitors to 900. Monitor access and updates on the Hawaii Division of State Parks Kalalau Trail web page."
28,"Camino Primitivo, Camino de Santiago, Spain",Hiking/Mountain,"There are many paths to the Shrine of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, but in true pilgrim spirit, sign on for the ninth-century route that the original pilgrim, Alfonso II of Asturias, took from Oviedo in northern Spain. The 15-day route receives only 4 percent of annual Camino trekkers, because it crosses the craggy, 8,000-plus-foot Cantabrian Mountains. The payoff, however, is killer views of the peaks of Picos de Europa and a halfway point marked by the third-century World Heritage site of Lugo, the only city in the world still surrounded by a fully intact Roman wall. In the lively market town of Melide, the Camino Primitivo joins forces with the more crowded Camino Frances for the last 36 miles. Stay in private or municipal albergues, hostels specifically for pilgrims, which vary in price, charm, size, and cleanliness. One of the most highly rated on the trail is the private, 14-room Cant�brico Fonsagrada. If time is an issue, REI offers a condensed nine-day version of the route."
29,"South Maroon Peak Maroon Bells, Colorado",Hiking/Mountain,"This trek is amazing! Choosing the best of Colorado�s 59 fourteeners is a little like being forced to pick your favorite child. We love the Bells because few peaks on the planet are more impressive than the behemoth 14,163-foot South Maroon (and its 14,019-foot twin, North Maroon, a third of a mile away). The alpine views of Maroon Creek Valley and the surrounding Elk Range from the summit of South Maroon, the true fourteener of the two, are astounding. And the awe is earned: these peaks are largely composed of sedimentary mudstone and are notorious for their loose, rotten rock up high, so bring your helmet. Even the standard, Class III South Ridge Route to the summit of South Maroon requires extensive time above the tree line, scrambling up often vertical rock. It�s a worthy 4,500-foot challenge, but it would be more relaxing to stay low and stick to the 1.5-mile-long Maroon Lake Scenic Trail."
30,"Lares Trek Lares, Peru",Hiking/Mountain,"Slightly shorter in length and higher in altitude that its famous sibling, the Inca Trail, this two-to-three-day trek starts in the village of Lares and traverses the Urubamba mountain range. It�s the best way to experience true Andean culture. You�ll see farmers hand-tilling potato fields at 10,000 feet, Quechua women wearing beautifully colored woven shawls while herding llama-like vicu�as, and cross 14,435-foot Ipsaycocha Pass, the highest point on the trek, before descending to the town of Ollantaytambo, where you can catch a train to Aguas Calientes, the jumping-off point for Machu Picchu. No permit is required for the trek, but going with a local guide is recommended. Hire the best through Explorandes Peru. For a more luxurious option, Mountain Lodges of Peru offers multi-day adventures combining day hikes, visits to villages and archeological sites, and farm-to-table meals at its tasteful, plush lodges throughout the Sacred and Lares Valleys."
31,"Paine Circuit Trek Torres del Paine National Park, Chile",Hiking/Mountain,"There are other, lesser known wilderness treks in Patagonia, like the Dientes Circuit on Navarino Island and the Las Horquetas Circuit in newly minted Cerro Castillo National Park. But if your heart�s set on seeing Torres del Paine National Park, the best way to avoid the crowds is to circumnavigate the entire Cordillera Paine. The beauty of this trek is that it includes the three iconic stops on the famous W circuit�the 12-mile, 2,500-foot hike to the base of the towers, the 360-degree view of the Paine Massif from the French Valley, and the retreating hulk of the Grey Glacier. But the full circuit continues to the back side of the cordillera, where the grandeur of the southern ice field and exquisite views to the massif can be enjoyed in solitude. Treat yourself to a few well-deserved rest days at Tierra Patagonia, a luxurious hotel so well disguised that it nearly disappears into the surrounding steppe. Park-visitation numbers are skyrocketing, and Patagonian weather is always unpredictable, so secure permits well in advance, preferably for September and October or April and May, the outer limits of the high season."
32,"Greenstone Ridge Trail, Michigan",Hiking/Mountain,"This is one of the few hikes in the U.S. where it�s entirely possible to see more moose than people, partially because it requires a ferry to even reach the trailhead on the western edge of the least visited national park in the lower 48. Once you�ve arrived at Windigo Harbor, you�ll climb 1,200 feet through lush green boreal forest, topping out at bald ridges before descending to pebble beaches scattered with the semiprecious chlorastrolite for which the trail is named. There are rustic shelters at designated campsites along the trail, and you can splurge on an eight-ounce filet of fresh lake trout at the end at the Lighthouse Restaurant before catching the ferry or float plane back to the Minnesota or Michigan mainland. If you can, plan your trip for late September or early October when the colors are popping and the mosquitoes have died off."
33,Buckskin Gulch to Paria Canyon via Wire Pass Trailhead,Hiking/Mountain,"There are better-known and more easily accessed slot canyons in Utah, but Buckskin Gulch in the northern section of Paria Canyon�Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness has the distinction of being one of the longest in the world, with uninterrupted narrows for 15 miles that rise up to 500 feet high in places. Start at Wire Pass Trailhead. This shortcut surpasses two miles of canyon walls but quickly puts you in the most spectacular sections of sandstone whorls, precipitous cliffs, and ancient petroglyphs. The hike requires rope for lowering gear through the canyons and may even necessitate waist-deep wading through water pools. Don�t rely on your weather app before attempting it; instead call the Paria Contact Station or the the Grand Staircase�Escalante National Monument Visitor Center in Kanab for essential updates on trail conditions."
34,"Tour du Mont Blanc Switzerland, Italy, France",Hiking/Mountain,"Compare French, Italian, and Swiss cuisine while trekking through all three countries on this circuit around 15,781-foot Mont Blanc, the highest peak in Western Europe. This is a full-on immersion course in real mountain living: you�ll gain some 32,000 feet, spy the most stunning peaks in the Alps, and stop in serious mountain towns like Chamonix and Courmayeur. Unlike other circuits, there are multiple starting points, plenty of route options, public transportation to shorten the trip if something goes awry, and a variety of accommodations, from mountain huts to five-star hotels. For a true vacation, let someone else handle all the logistics, like Ryder-Walker Alpine Adventures or MT Sobek. Or if your legs and lungs can handle it, the route also makes for the most luxurious trail run over 100 miles."
35,"Old Rag Shenandoah National Park, Virginia",Hiking/Mountain,"So named for its underlying, billion-year-old �old rag� granite, this iconic East Coast peak became a magnet for rock climbers back in the 1930s, and located a mere 100 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., the 3,284-foot Blue Ridge Mountain is still well traveled. Avoid the crowds by climbing it midweek in winter. Or if you don�t mind other hikers and want to see some of its 850 species of flowering plants, including trillium, wild ginger, showy orchids, and saxifrage, plan your trip to coincide with the park�s annual Wildflower Weekend, which falls on May 11�12 this year. After a two-mile switchback ascent through thick deciduous forest, the trail scrambles around granite boulders, up a natural staircase of quartz and feldspar, and tops out at numerous false summits before reaching the true summit and the best view of the sprawling, 200,000-acre Shenandoah National Park."
36,"Chogoria Route to Point Lenana Peak, Kenya",Hiking/Mountain,"At 17,057 feet, Mount Kenya is Africa�s second-highest peak, but the dormant volcano receives far fewer trekkers than 19,341-foot Kilmanjaro. It also offers more wildlife, like elephants and Cape buffalo, and impressively varied and beautiful terrain, from bamboo rainforests to moors akin to the Scottish Highlands. The most scenic and interesting nontechnical route is Chogoria, which takes hikers through the gorgeous Gorges Valley, home to misty views and waterfalls that cascade over precipitous cliffs, to 16,354-foot Point Lenana, the closest you can get to the summit without technical climbing skills. It�s also the best place in Kenya to watch the sunrise and get a view of the mountain�s twin summits: 17,057-foot Batian and 17,021-foot Nelion. The driest months, January, February, and September, are the best time to hike. Outfitter Mountain Madness offers a combo trek that�s followed by safaris in Samburu National Reserve and Sweetwater Reserve."
37,"Fisherfields Round Fisherfield Forest, Scotland",Hiking/Mountain,"Known as the Great Wilderness, this hike in northwest Scotland tackles the country�s five most remote Munros, peaks of over 3,000 feet with names like Bein a Chlaidheimh and Sgurr Ban. Traversing bogs, heather, grassy slopes, knife-edge ridges, boulders, and scree, you�re in for a quintessential Highlands hike. But don�t be fooled by the relatively low altitude. The highest point on the naked summit of Mullach Coire Mhic Fhearchair may only be 3,343 feet, but these peaks also contain the most remote square mile in all of Great Britain, and weather can change on a dime. Most trekkers take at least two days and start at the Shenavall bothy, a hostel used by climbers summitting nearby An Teallach, but wilderness camping almost anywhere along the route is also an option, no permit required. Wilderness Scotland has expert guides and can customize this trip or a more luxurious (and Scotch-filled) itinerary."
38,"Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim, Arizona",Hiking/Mountain,"Of the five million people who visit Grand Canyon National Park every year, less than 1 percent descend the grueling 14.6-mile, 5,850-foot North Kaibab Trail to the bottom of the canyon, then hike 9.6 miles and 4,460 feet back up the other side on the Bright Angel Trail. The reward is trekking through 11 layers of rock and two billion years of geologic history. The dizzying views of the big chasm aren�t bad either. Enter the lottery as early as 15 months prior to your planned trip and you may even be able to spend a night at Phantom Ranch, the 1920s-era rustic cabins on the bank of Bright Angel Creek and the most coveted reservation in the national-park system. While most hike the route, some mad souls run rim-to-rim-to-rim in one go."
39,Mount Washington via Tuckerman Ravine,Hiking/Mountain,"First climbed in 1692 by Darby Field and his Abenaki guides, the summit of 6,288-foot Mount Washington is far from an unknown entity. It is, however, a rite of passage for aspiring East Coast mountaineers and deceivingly dangerous, with colder temperatures than Washington�s Mount Rainier and the highest wind speed ever recorded in the United States at 231 miles per hour. Starting at Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, the trail meanders through mixed hardwood forest and over Cutler River bridges before opening up to the glacial cirque of Tuckerman Ravine and a 1.8-mile, above-tree-line scramble over scree to the summit. The payoff is the view of the White Mountains and surrounding Presidential Range, the highest in the northeast. For the latest trail updates, visit Friends of Tuckerman Ravine."
40,"Panorama Ridge Garibaldi Provincial Park, Canada",Hiking/Mountain,"You could throw a dart at a map of Western Canada and land on a world-class hike, but we finally picked Panorama Ridge as the best route in the region because the nearly 20-mile out-and-back offers such classic, consistent alpine scenery. Starting at the Rubble Creek Trailhead, 20 miles south of Whistler Village via the Sea-to-Sky Highway, the trail rises 4,987 feet, first into a spray of wildflowers at Taylor Meadows, then along the south flank of Black Tusk, a massive 7,608-foot pinnacle of black volcanic rock, and finally on to the top of the 6,998-foot ridge, where there are 360-degree views of snow-dappled Mounts Price and Garibaldi and the flat-topped, disintegrating volcano known as the Table, all rising from the turquoise water of Garibaldi Lake. It�s possible to make the summit push and return in one day, but with vistas like this, why rush it? Stop for a cooling dip on the way down at glacial-fed Garibaldi Lake, then pitch a tent at Garibaldi Lake Campground. Advance reservations are required."
41,"Three Capes Track Tasmania, Australia",Hiking/Mountain,"Of all the amazing treks in Australia, the Three Capes Track on the Tasman Peninsula is the most otherworldly. A 90-minute drive from the state capital of Hobart, it starts with an hourlong boat ride from Port Arthur Historic Site, the eerie 1830s penal colony that once housed the worst criminals in the British Empire. A custom-made speedboat designed to handle the crashing waves of the Southern Ocean takes trekkers across Maingon Bay, home to fur seals, dolphins, and migratory whales, to Denman�s Cove. The Y-shaped trek winds through coastal heath, up cut-stone paths to eventually traverse the tops of the 1,000-foot-high dolerite columns of Capes Pillar and Hauy, both of which drop straight into the sea. There are three plush national park huts, all of which contain board games, deck chairs, yoga mats, memory-foam beds, and a shared kitchen. If you�d prefer a fully-guided option, or want to carry a lighter pack, the new Three Capes Lodge Walk includes roundtrip transfers from Hobart, exclusive lodge accommodation, and meals. Don�t bother trying to figure out where the third cape is. The last 23-mile link to Cape Raoul has yet to be completed."
42,"Teton Crest Trail Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming",Hiking/Mountain,"July through September, you�ll be hard-pressed to find a trailhead in Grand Teton National Park that isn�t packed with coach buses. Get, quite literally, above the selfie snappers on this three-to-five-day hike, which traverses not only the park but two national forests (Bridger-Teton and Caribou-Targhee) and the Jedediah Smith Wilderness. This high-alpine route, which rarely drops below 8,000 feet, ascends for a total of 8,061 feet and has views of the iconic Tetons throughout. Hit your timing right in July and you�ll pass wildflower meadows blooming with lupine, western coneflower, paintbrush, and more. If you must post your epic on social media, respect Jackson Hole�s social-media guidelines and turn off the geotagging function. The route is also listed on of the best trail runs in the world."
43,"Superior Hiking Trail Duluth, Minnesota, to the Canadian Border",Hiking/Mountain,"This steep, rocky, narrow trail runs from the Minnesota/Wisconsin border outside of Jay Cooke State Park, southwest of Duluth, clear to the Canadian border and is filled with constant and challenging elevation changes (total gain is 37,800 feet going north), shady pine and deciduous forests, and near constant water sources filtered from quiet lakes or rushing streams, many of which have multitiered waterfalls that crash toward Lake Superior. The trail intersects numerous roads along the way, making it easy to a reserve shuttle and mix up backcountry camping with a walleye dinner and a night in a high-thread-count bed at classic Lake Superior shoreline lodges like Lutsen Resort. Because the route is managed by a small non-profit which doesn't have the bandwidth to field questions from every potential hiker, your best bet for beta is to pick up the organization's comprehensive Guide to the Superior Hiking Trail."
44,"Lycian Way Fethiye to Antalya, Turkey",Hiking/Mountain,"Travel through Greek, Roman, and Christian history on a 29-day route that stretches along Turkey�s southern Tekke Peninsula. Comprised of a stone road, mule paths, and footpaths, the well-marked way meanders along the mountainous coastline, dipping into centuries-old ruins and ancient cities along the way. Historic sites are everywhere, but some of the more interesting are the rock tombs of Myra, the eternally burning flames of Chimera, and the seaside amphitheater of Antiphellos. Spring and fall are the best time to trek the route, when the Mediterranean is still warm enough for swimming, paddling, and playing. With the exception of three remote mountainous sections where camping is necessary, accommodations are available in the cities and villages along the route. For a more decadent way to see the stunning Turquoise Coast, check out Wilderness Travel�s expedition, which plies the same coastline from the comfort of a gulet, a two-masted sailboat."
45,"Appalachian Trail Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee",Hiking/Mountain,"Of the Appalachian Trail�s 2,200 miles, there�s something extra magical about the 72-mile section through Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It may be the way the mist clings to the ancient ridges and rocky outcrops; the abundance of flaming azaleas, lupines, and rhododendrons; or the knowledge that 6,625-foot Clingman�s Dome is the highest summit along the entire AT. Whatever the reason, this strenuous seven-day section is the best way to dodge the park�s 11.3 million annual visitors. There�s only one road crossing, at Newfound Gap, on the entire stretch. There are, however, 12 comfortable backcountry shelters, all of which sleep at least a dozen. Beware that AT thru-hikers need a different permit than hikers covering only the Great Smoky Mountains National Park section."
46,"Whale Trail De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa",Hiking/Mountain,"Between June and November, the De Hoop Nature Reserve, 145 miles east of Cape Town, becomes the best place in the world to witness migrating right whales without stepping foot on a boat. Maximize viewing time with this leisurely five-day stroll that starts inland in the shadow of 1,935-foot Potberg Mountain before descending through fields of fynbos and other wildflowers to the searing white-sand beaches and tide pools that line this stretch of the Indian Ocean. The second night�s stay in Noetsie Hut is a highlight, with its sleek design, two outdoor fire pits, and a deck for watching right whales or gazing at the Milky Way.

47,"Chilkoot Trail Dyea, Alaska, to Bennett Lake, Canada",Hiking/Mountain,"Though it�s just a fraction of the original 600-mile trek to the Klondike, the first 33-mile section of the Chilkoot�which starts in the Alaskan ghost town of Dyea, summits 3,759-foot Chilkoot Pass, and ends at Bennett Lake, British Columbia�gives hikers a taste of the wild vistas and extreme hardships prospectors experienced during the gold fever of the late 1800s.
